# lcmap-firebird
Apache Spark based product generation for LCMAP.

## Planned Features
* Run and retrieve results and job status for all LCMAP products from the command line.
* Run jobs synchronously or asynchronously.
* Retrieve model inputs from LCMAP HTTP services or local files, determine availability, generate status reports.
* Save science model outputs to Apache Cassandra, local files, or stdout.
* Connect to remote, local or embedded Spark clusters.
* Execute Jupyter Notebooks inside the Firebird Docker image using the same libraries as the ops system.

## Setup

* Install Docker

* Install Conda (works with miniconda3 version 4.3.16)

* Create and activate a conda environment
```bash
   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
   $ conda create --name firebird --file environment.txt
   $ source activate firebird
```

## Testing
```bash
 make docker-deps-up
 nose2
 make docker-deps-down
```

* Command line
```bash
```

* Jupyter
```bash
```

## Testing

```$ pytest```

## Implementation Wants
* Utilize xarray for input handling
* All code should be written according to functional principles... immutability, purity, substitution, statelessness.
* Code should be written according to functional principles wherever possible... immutability, purity, substitution, statelessness.
